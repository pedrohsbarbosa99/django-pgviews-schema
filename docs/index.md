Welcome to our project documentation! We provide first-class support for PostgreSQL Views in the Django ORM, along with custom schema support.

This project is a fork of the original [django-pgviews-redux][django-pgviews-redux] by [xelixdev][xelixdev], PostgreSQL schemas.

### Key Features

- Custom schema support
- Compatibility with Django 3.2+

### About the Project

Our documentation aims to provide comprehensive information on utilizing PostgreSQL Views in Django, as well as custom schema features. You'll find detailed insights, examples, and guides to make the most of this functionality in your Django projects.

Explore our documentation to harness the power of PostgreSQL Views and streamline your Django development!

**Disclaimer:** This project will be actively maintained until the original project implements the schema discovery feature. Once the original project adds this feature, we encourage you to transition back to it for ongoing support and updates. Our goal is to provide a solution in the interim and support the community's needs until the feature is available in the official project.
