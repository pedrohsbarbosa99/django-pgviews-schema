## Examples

```python
from django.db import models

from django_pgviews import view as pg


class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    post_code = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    is_preferred = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'myapp'

class PreferredCustomer(pg.View):
    projection = ['myapp.Customer.*',]
    dependencies = ['myapp.OtherView',]
    sql = """SELECT * FROM myapp_customer WHERE is_preferred = TRUE;"""

    class Meta:
      app_label = 'myapp'
      db_table = 'myapp_preferredcustomer'
      managed = False
```

**NOTE** It is important that we include the `managed = False` in the `Meta` so
Django 1.7 migrations don't attempt to create DB tables for this view.

The SQL produced by this might look like:

```postgresql
CREATE VIEW myapp_preferredcustomer AS
SELECT * FROM myapp_customer WHERE is_preferred = TRUE;
```

To create all your views, run `python manage.py sync_pgviews`

You can also specify field names, which will map onto fields in your View:

```python
from django_pgviews import view as pg


VIEW_SQL = """
    SELECT name, post_code FROM myapp_customer WHERE is_preferred = TRUE
"""


class PreferredCustomer(pg.View):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    post_code = models.CharField(max_length=20)

    sql = VIEW_SQL
```
